# Movie-Rating-Analysis

Introduction:This project contains a Python analysis conducted using a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis involves various data processing and visualization techniques applied to a dataset to uncover insights and trends.
Objective:The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset of movie ratings to discover  interesting patterns and insights, such as average ratings, most popular movies, and  user preferences.
1.Importing the necessary Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas) and loading the two  datasets.
2.Data Loading and Preprocessing:1.Steps for loading the data into the notebook.2.Cleaning and preprocessing the data for analysis.
3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the data distribution and key patterns.
4.Data Analysis:Specific analysis tasks performed on the dataset,including:1.Statistical analysis.2.Results and interpretations.
Conclusion:The analysis of movie ratings using Python provides insights into user preferencesand movie characteristics. The results show that most movies are rated positively. thetop 10 movies with the highest  number of 10 ratings are identified . This analysis canhelp movie enthusiasts make informed decisions about which movies to watch.
